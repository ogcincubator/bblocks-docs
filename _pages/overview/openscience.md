# The Role of OGC Building Blocks in Advancing Open Science

(work in progress - do not link)

## Overview

Science requires reproducability.

This requires detailed documentation of many aspects of the methodology and execution, as well as the inputs and results. Such documentation becomes extremely complex to create and interpret - but this is greatly facilitated by standardised structures and contents. Open Science increasingly aims for machine-readability (as far as possible) of these descriptions to support validation and reuse of the underlying science through repeatable **workflows**.

Scientific workflows are increasingly complex, encompassing not only data but also APIs, metadata structures, vocabularies, and methodological descriptions. Reusability, transparency, and interoperability across these components are essential for ensuring research processes align with the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles. The OGC Building Blocks methodology offers a structured, component-based approach to standardization, validation, and discovery that directly supports these goals. This white paper explores its strategic relevance for open science.

## 1. The Challenge of Specification Fragmentation

Many interoperability specifications—especially those used in the geospatial and environmental sciences—include rich and varied components such as schemas, ontologies, and APIs. However, these components are often embedded in natural language documents, obscuring machine-readable relationships and dependencies. This lack of transparency hinders reuse and makes validation difficult.

For example, during the Nov 2024 Metadata CodeSprint ([citesprint2024]), challenges were observed in reconciling metadata standards like ISO 19115, DCAT, STAC, and GeoDCAT. Without a modular structure, aligning or profiling such standards across different domains requires manual interpretation and ad hoc tooling.

## 2. Building Blocks: A Methodology for Specification Modularity

The OGC Building Block methodology provides a systematic approach for:

- Packaging atomic components of specifications (schemas, requirements, examples, tests, transformations).
- Documenting relationships between components, including inheritance, profiling, or conformance constraints.
- Validating and testing examples and implementations in a CI/CT environment.
- Publishing metadata-rich representations of these components as Linked Data in a Knowledge Graph.

This approach supports the use of mapping scripts and profiling files, as illustrated in prior work on JSON-LD context file splitting and namespace separation ([jsonldsplit]).

## 3. Enabling Interoperability in Scientific Workflows

Scientific workflows commonly involve combinations of metadata standards, data exchange formats, and processing algorithms. The Building Block methodology enhances these workflows in several key ways:

- **Profiling and Composition**: Researchers can construct domain-specific profiles by assembling relevant building blocks from multiple standards.
- **Mapping and Transformation**: Explicit mappings (e.g., GeoDCAT to ISO 19115) can be authored, registered, and validated as first-class artefacts.
- **Lifecycle Integration**: Tools and datasets can reference specific building blocks, embedding interoperability validation directly into the workflow lifecycle.

This was evident in the application of profile-based JSON schema generation and modular schema production by namespace ([schemasplit]).

## 4. Supporting FAIR and Reproducible Science

The Building Block methodology aligns with and supports the FAIR principles:

- **Findability**: Building blocks are published in a standardized form with metadata suitable for indexing in registries and knowledge graphs.
- **Accessibility**: Blocks are retrievable as standalone artefacts, with versioning and licensing clearly documented.
- **Interoperability**: Semantic mappings, conformance relationships, and transformation tools can be directly expressed and tested.
- **Reusability**: Blocks can be referenced, composed, and refined without duplicating entire specifications.

## 5. Strategic Recommendations

To promote open science through better standards infrastructure, the following actions are recommended:

- Adopt building block principles when designing scientific data standards and workflows.
- Encourage standards bodies to modularize specifications using the OGC Building Blocks model.
- Develop tooling to register and discover building blocks, enabling automated integration into scientific platforms.
- Engage research communities in the validation and curation of reusable components.

## Conclusion

The OGC Building Block methodology offers a practical, future-proof path to composable, transparent, and validated specifications. Its application in the scientific domain can significantly lower the cost of interoperability, increase reuse of data and services, and help ensure that science is not only open—but also robustly machine-actionable.
