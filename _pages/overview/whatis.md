An Building Block is a way of packaging a component of a **specification** that can be re-used in other specifications.

For various reasons specifications have often made statements in text regarding how they relate to other specifications, and created implementation artefacts such as schemas that may not make these intentions explicit. The following diagram shows how Building Blocks form a value-added packaging option for such specification elements that can then be exploited as part of a comprehensive knowledge base to support discovery and re-use (FAIR principles).
