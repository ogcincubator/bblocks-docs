OGC BuildingBlocks are published as registers (collections), with each repository defining a sub-register that can be aggregated.

Aggregated registers will all have their own governance regimes, which SHOULD be clearly defined as documentation describing scope and rules for inclusion.

Key examples include:

- [OGC Specification Building Blocks](https://opengeospatial.github.io/bblocks/register/) - Building Blocks defined by OGC specifications. (_may include common utility patterns common to multiple specifications_)
- [OGC Incubator Building Blocks](https://ogcincubator.github.io/bblocks/) - Building Blocks needed by multiple application domains. (_not yet formally transferred to an appropriate SWG_)
- [Examples](https://ogcincubator.github.io/bblocks-examples/) - Examples of different types and usage patterns. (_these are NOT intended as reuse except in examples and tutorials_)
- [Tutorial](https://ogcincubator.github.io/bblocks-tutorial/) - a step-wise introduction to various features and configuration details for Building Blocks.
