This is the documentation for OGC Building Blocks, a specification component packaging approach that can be used to **add documentation** to existing specification components, or to assemble specifications cost-effectively using a test-driven approach.

Building Blocks may be various [types](/bblocks-docs/overview/types) - however the emphasis is semantically annotated schemas for use in OGC API definitions. 

A key application is the [register of OGC Specification Building blocks](https://opengeospatial.github.io/bblocks/register/)

This packaging supports testing of examples, and validation using rules inherited from other Building Blocks that are re-used (by aggregation or profiling) to create compatible specifications for specific applications.

OGC BuildingBlocks can be organised into [registers](/bblocks-docs/overview/registers) for convenience, each repository creating a local register that can be aggregated into another application domain register.
