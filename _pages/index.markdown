This is the documentation for OGC Building Blocks, a specification component packaging approach that can be used to **add documentation** to existing specification components, or to assemble specifications cost-effectively using a test-driven approach.

This packaging supports testing of examples, and validation using rules inherited from other Building Blocks that are re-used (by aggregation or profiling) to create compatible specifications for specific applications.

Building Blocks make various different [types](/overview/types) of specification component accessible in a common, convenient form and registers.  A key innovation is support for **semantically annotated schemas**, suitable for use in OpenAPI definitions. 

The Building Block documentation framework is the basis of the [register of OGC Specification Building blocks](https://opengeospatial.github.io/bblocks/register/). 

OGC BuildingBlocks can be organised into [registers](/overview/registers) for convenience, each repository creating a local register that can be aggregated into another application domain register.
