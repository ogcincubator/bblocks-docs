This is the documentation for the OGC Building Blocks framework, a **specification component** packaging approach.

This supports the FAIR principles for **specifications** - with every specification being a component that can be re-used. For more discussion see [Design Principles](/overview/principles)

Building Blocks can be used to **add documentation** to existing specification components, or to **design** and **assemble** reusable specification components cost-effectively using a test-driven approach.

Building Blocks are _"technology agnostic"_ - i.e. may be various [types](overview/types) - however a  emphasis is support for semantically annotated JSON schemas for use in OGC API definitions. 

Building Blocks can be organised into [registers](overview/registers) for convenience, each repository creating a local register that can be integrated with other application domain registers.

Published OGC API specifications are, or will be, described in the [register of OGC Specification Building blocks](https://opengeospatial.github.io/bblocks/register/). The framework can be used for development of specifications or publication of specifications in your own application domain.  The framework supports transparent **federation of Building Block registers.**

The framework supports testing of examples, and validation using rules inherited from other Building Blocks that are re-used (by aggregation or profiling) to create compatible specifications for specific applications.
