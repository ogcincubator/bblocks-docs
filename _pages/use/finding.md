Whilst components described as Building Blocks may be referenced by individual specifications, due to evolution of the specification publication process over time this is not consistent in terms of identification or disposition of published artefacts. Such components may be published as discrete resources, or bundled in larger packages. They may or may not be in consistent machine-readable forms. This leads to many challenges for discovery of such components.  General text search options may assist, but will be subject to limited ability to precisely recall only relevant components.

The OGC Building Block Framework provides three improved approaches for discovery:

1. [Registers](/overview/registers)
1. [RAINBOW (OGC Knowledge Graph)]() 
1. Transparent Dependencies 


# Well-known Building Blocks registers

## OGC Specifications

- [OGC Specification Building Blocks](https://opengeospatial.github.io/bblocks/register/) - Building Blocks defined by OGC specifications. (_may include common utility patterns common to multiple specifications_)

## OGC Specifications (in development)

- [OGC API - SOSA](https://opengeospatial.github.io/ogcapi-sosa/) - Implementation of the [OMS/ISO 19156 standard](http://www.opengis.net/def/docs/20-082r4) using the [SOSA ontology](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-ssn/).
- [OGC API Records - GeoDCAT](https://ogcincubator.github.io/geodcat-ogcapi-records/) - Implementation of GeoDCAT using OGC API Records

## Incubator

- [OGC Incubator Building Blocks](https://ogcincubator.github.io/bblocks/) - Building Blocks needed by multiple application domains. (_not yet formally transferred to an appropriate SWG_)
