Whilst components described as Building Blocks may be referenced by individual specifications, due to evolution and legacy issues this is not consistent and is a challenge for discovery.  General text search options may assist.

The OGC Building Block Framework provides two improved approaches:

1. [Registers](/overview/registers)
1. [RAINBOW (OGC Knowledge Graph)]() 

# Well-known Building Blocks registers

## OGC Specifications

- [OGC Specification Building Blocks](https://opengeospatial.github.io/bblocks/register/) - Building Blocks defined by OGC specifications. (_may include common utility patterns common to multiple specifications_)

## OGC Specifications (in development)

- [OGC API - SOSA](https://opengeospatial.github.io/ogcapi-sosa/) - Implementation of the [OMS/ISO 19156 standard](http://www.opengis.net/def/docs/20-082r4) using the [SOSA ontology](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-ssn/).
- [OGC API Records - GeoDCAT](https://ogcincubator.github.io/geodcat-ogcapi-records/) - Implementation of GeoDCAT using OGC API Records

## Incubator

- [OGC Incubator Building Blocks](https://ogcincubator.github.io/bblocks/) - Building Blocks needed by multiple application domains. (_not yet formally transferred to an appropriate SWG_)
