# Building Blocks Tutorials

A range of tutorials will provide step by step introduction to the features of OGC Building Blocks.

Please raise an [issue](https://github.com/ogcincubator/bblocks-docs/issues) for new tutorial requests

## Tutorials

### [Core](https://ogcincubator.github.io/bblocks-tutorial/)

This steps through the core features of the OGC Building Blocks framework with an emphasis on OGC API ready, semantically enabled JSON schemas.


## Planned tutorials

### Governance

A description of various governance patterns and an introduction to OGC Policies and Procedures in relation to Building Blocks.

### Building interoperable metadata profiles (STAC, Records, 19115, DCAT etc)

This will focus on metadata design and the various extension and profiling mechanisms for metadata standards relevant to the OGC mission.

Transformations and testing will be a key aspect due to the variations schemas and encoding technologies in use.

### Data transformations

Transformations will be a constant challenge, and a wide range of transformation languages and tools may be needed - this tutorial will show options and how to extend the framework to include your own transformation tools.

### Semantic Model Publishing

Publishing semantic (RDF, OWL, SHACL) etc models is difficult due to limitations of existing tools. This tutorial will demonstrate how to factor semantic models into FAIR building blocks and make the model itself FAIR.

### UML models

UML models are notoriously difficult to manage in a modular fashion - this tutorial will focus on FAIR UML models - composition and testing.
