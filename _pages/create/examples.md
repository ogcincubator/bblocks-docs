Examples help developers understand how they can integrate the building block into their applications. Code snippets in specific programming languages, are not only supported, but encouraged.

Each example consists of Markdown `content` and/or a list of `snippets`. `snippets`, in turn,
have a `language` (for highlighting, language tabs in Slate, etc.) and the `code` itself.

`content` accepts text in Markdown format. Any relative links or images will be resolved to full
URLs when the building block is published (see [Assets](#assets)).

Instead of the `code`, a `ref` with a filename relative to `examples.yaml` can be provided:

```yaml
examples:
  - title: My inline example
    content: Example with its code in the examples.yaml file
    snippets:
      - language: json
        code: '{ "a": 1 }'
  - title: My referenced example
    content: Example with its code pulled from a file
    snippets:
      - language: json
        ref: example1.json # in the same directory as examples.yaml
```

Please refer to
[the updated JSON schema for `examples.yaml`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opengeospatial/bblocks-postprocess/master/ogc/bblocks/examples-schema.yaml)
for more information.

The `examples.yaml` file in `my-building-block` can be used as a template.

## Prefixes

Optionally, you can add a `prefixes` entry at the top level (alongside `examples:`) or inside a specific snippet,
with a dictionary of prefix-to-URI mappings, allowing you to omit those prefixes when used in JSON, JSON-LD and
Turtle examples, but that will be used when semantically uplifting the snippets.
