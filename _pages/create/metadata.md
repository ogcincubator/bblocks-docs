Building block metadata provides context information about the item in the building blocks register. It is based on [ISO 19135](https://www.iso.org/standard/54721.html), the standard for item registration of geographic information, from which it extracted its six mandatory items (flagged with *). The ISO schema is extended with other properties (in green), which account for things such as the visual representation in the register, item validation or relation with other building blocks.
